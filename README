  What does this do?
 ====================

  This program will automatically build and install a compiler and other
  tools used in the creation of homebrew software for the Sony Playstation 3
  videogame system.

 ==================
  How do I use it?
 ==================

 1) Set up your environment by installing the following software:

  autoconf, automake, bison, flex, gcc, make, makeinfo/texinfo, ncurses (devel),
  patch, subversion, and wget

 2) Create a location for the toolchain, make sure you have write access to
    wherever you chose.

  mkdir /usr/local/ps3dev
  or
  mkdir /opt/ps3dev
  or
  mkdir ~/ps3dev

 3) Add the following to your login script:

  export PS3DEV=/location/above/ps3dev
  export PATH=$PATH:$PS3DEV/bin
  export PATH=$PATH:$PS3DEV/ppu/bin
  export PATH=$PATH:$PS3DEV/spu/bin

 4) Run the toolchain script:

  ./ps3toolchain.sh
